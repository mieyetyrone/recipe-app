# recipe-app
This simple recipe app allows users to add recipe information (recipe title, recipe ingredients and preparation steps). It also enables the users to retrieve the available recipes. The "ADD RECIPE" page contains a section for adding ingredients. Each ingredients should be inserted separately, then click the "Add ingredient" button after each input. Please note that this app uses the session storage as its storage. This may lead to unexpected behaviour if session storage is not supported.
